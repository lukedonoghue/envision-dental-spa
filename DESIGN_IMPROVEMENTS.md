# Design & Layout Improvements for Envision Dental Landing Page

- Lack of visual hierarchy and flow between sections
- Insufficient CTAs throughout the page
- Missing dynamic elements and micro-interactions
- Monotonous section transitions

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Layout Variety & Visual Flow
- **Alternating Layouts**: Switch between left-aligned, right-aligned, and centered content
- **Diagonal Section Dividers**: Replace straight horizontal dividers with angled/curved transitions
